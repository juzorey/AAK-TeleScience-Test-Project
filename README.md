## Introduction
Used React.js, Django RestFramwork and React ApexCharts to create funnel chart of your country's population
For the requiements of the best test, I used best practices with Api, State Handling, Race Control, Throttling, Class Based Views, Data Fixtures and Optimization
- The ports are open to all so you may view the rest framework and call from any port

 - For the rquierments of this project, I  didn't implement redux, react-query or axios since it would've added unnecesary omplexity for a project that had less than 10 states and a small dataset project
 - Neccesarliy  for scaliblity would use redux, react-query, axios, django authentication, django signals, django businesslogic seperation, django permissions, django security keys
